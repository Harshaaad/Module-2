    "## Exploring Multimodal Capabilities of LLaVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal models are AI systems that process and integrate multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, or video, to generate richer and more context-aware outputs. These models enhance understanding by leveraging complementary information across different modalities, improving tasks like image captioning, language translation, and interactive AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how to make the model generate image descriptions based on an input image. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use LLaVA, which is a novel end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines a vision encoder and Vicuna for general-purpose visual and language understanding."

    "## Lab Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores the multimodal capabilities of **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)** by leveraging its ability to process and generate textual descriptions from images. Participants will load a pretrained LLaVA model and use it to generate image captions, analyze visual content, and interpret images. Through hands-on exercises, learners will gain insights into how multimodal models integrate visual and textual information to enhance AI understanding. \n",

    "- Understand Multimodal AI and LLaVAâ€™s Capabilities.\n",
    "- Generate and Analyze Image Descriptions.\n",

The main difference seems to be the time of day due to the positioning of the sun.
